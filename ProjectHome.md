16/2/14 - **An issue has been identified with the scripts when using the latest version of Sunny Explorer (1.07.09). SMA have changed the export format of the CSV. Download version PV4.4 of PVupload to use with latest version of Sunny Explorer.**


Script has been designed to poll your SMA Sunny Boy Inverter using the Sunny Explorer command line extract process. (Sunny Explorer needs to be installed first).
The CSV that is extracted is then used to upload data to pvoutput.org.
Windows scheduler is then used to run the script every 10 minutes.

Check out the Wiki link above to view all the details about this script via the README file.

TWO NEW VERSIONS ADDED 25/03/14 - PV4.4 and PV4.4\_Upgrade. **Use the DOWNLOADS link to the left for the latest version.**
(or here: [http://drive.google.com/PVupload](http://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2i7ocopVtGjZkFNV01vYnZMMUk&usp=sharing))

Team added to pvoutput for anyone using this script.

Please email me directly with any issues so I can attend to them quicker than logging them on here. If any issues with the script are uncovered I will release updates here ASAP.
Also, please email me if you wish to be notified of all future releases. I do not check this site very often so email is the best way to stay in touch.

Donations: I have been asked a few times about accepting donations for this project. Please prioritize donations to the pvoutput.org website but if you wish to contribute to the PVupload project then you are welcome to send a donation via paypal to gazglids@picknowl.com.au. Thank you.

Cheers,<br>Gary
